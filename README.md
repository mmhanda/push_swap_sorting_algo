# push_swap_sorting_algorithme
programe that it's made to sort big mount of numbers in quick time using C


Push_swap algo allow you to sort a stack with minimum instruction possible

The Push swap project is a very simple and a highly straightforward algorithm project: data must be sorted. You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions to manipulate both stacks. Your goal? Write a program in C called push_swap which calculates and displays on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push swap language instructions, that sorts the integers received as arguments.

The rules
* You have 2 stacks named a and b.
* At the beginning:
* The stack a contains a random amount of negative and/or positive numbers which cannot be duplicated.
* The stack b is empty.
* The goal is to sort in ascending order numbers into stack a. To do so you have the

following operations to use:

sa (swap a): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
sb (swap b): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
ss : sa and sb at the same time.
pa (push a): Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a. Do nothing if b is empty.
pb (push b): Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b. Do nothing if a is empty.
ra (rotate a): Shift up all elements of stack a by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
rb (rotate b): Shift up all elements of stack b by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
rr : ra and rb at the same time.
rra (reverse rotate a): Shift down all elements of stack a by 1.
The last element becomes the first one.
rrb (reverse rotate b): Shift down all elements of stack b by 1.
The last element becomes the first one.
rrr : rra and rrb at the same time.

HOW TO RUN THE TESTER

For 100 number:

./script.bash 100 701

for 500 number :

./script.bash 500 5501
